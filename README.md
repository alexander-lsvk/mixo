# Technical details: #

Just for the fast MVP firebase was choosen and a lot of operations happen on the front-end side. 
Architecture is simple MVP just for breaking down business logic.
In the future it would be nice to have all mixing algorithms on a backend and rewrite everything with SwiftUI and Combine stack.
